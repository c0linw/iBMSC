µBMSC
=====
µBMSC is a modified version of iBMSC to add features and clean up the iBMSC code, fix bugs and so on.
See README.md.old for original iBMSC README file.

**BMSdori**
=====
* IMPLEMENTED:
  * Note colors set based on known Bandori note labels.
  * Sliderbodies implemented for Bandori-style cross-lane slides.
  * LN drawing functions modified to support colored notes.
* TODO:
  * Include fever activation notes in Bandori note tag checks
  * Create blank file with WAV labels preset for Bandori charts
	  * The more I test, the more I realize how badly I need this feature
  
* I don't even know how to use the BMS previewers myself, so I'll figure that out later. Would be cool to create a custom previewer using Burrito's code for bandorichart.

* NT (NoteTool) style input *can* be used for Bandori charting, but it is not recommended.
	BMSE style is better because it allows input of different LN start/end notes
